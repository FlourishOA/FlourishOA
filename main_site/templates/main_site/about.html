            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Flourish is a data-driven web app and API enabling users to discover relevant and reputable
                Open Access (OA) publications in order to maximize publishing impact. By aggregating price information
                and impact data, we empower researchers to identify credible OA journals that best fit their publication
                needs. Our goal is to provide the OA community with the tools they need to separate legitimate OA
                publications from unethical and predatory publishers. Additionally, we believe that adding transparency
                to OA markets will produce downward price pressure, further lowering economic barriers to entry in
                scholarly publishing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Open Access (OA) movement grew from the traditional idea of research and scholarship as a public
                good. As the rapid growth of the Internet revolutionized our ability distribute and consume information,
                a set of principles began forming around the notion of "free and unrestricted access" to scholarly
                literature. On February 14, 2002, the <a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read)">Budapest Open
                Access Initiative</a> codified these principles in a formal statement, laying out a framework for what
                we now know as the OA movement. Broadly speaking,
                Open Access is the free and immediate, online distribution of research and scholarship, along with
                unrestricted access and usage rights for the end-user. These principles stand athwart traditional
                academic publishing models that lock scholarship behind increasingly cost-prohibitive paywalls,
                restricting access and limiting participation in scholarly discourse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bolstered by early adopters like the Public Library of Science (PLoS), Biomed Central, and Creative
                Commons, as well as broad support from a number of research institutions, academic associations, funding
                bodies and governments, the OA movement has grown into a robust and innovative community of practice.
                Publishers are experimenting with business models that incorporate OA principles, and governments are
                increasingly looking to OA policies as a way to improve stewardship of taxpayer-funded research. In
                October 2016, the <a href="http://doaj.org">Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)</a>
                listed 9,210 OA journals from 129 countries, indexing over 2.3 million OA articles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The emerging OA marketplace presents new opportunities and challenges for scholars, funding bodies and
                publishers looking to thrive in this new environment. Author-pay publishing models shift the financial
                burden from the consumer to the funding body, usually in the form of article processing charges (APCs).
                An influx of new OA publications, combined with a paucity of clear economic information has created a
                great deal of uncertainty in this market. Capitalizing on this uncertainty are a number of "predatory"
                publishers that employ unethical and deceptive practices to extract fees from researchers, offering
                only a pretense of peer-review in return. Scholars like
                <a href="https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/">Jeffrey Beall</a> have developed criteria and
                processes for identifying predatory publishers. The
                <a href="https://eigenfactor.org">Eigenfactor Project</a> uses network analysis to
                examine scholarly impact, along with economic data from OA publications, to produce quantifiable metrics
                for cost-effectiveness. Flourish provides users with a practical implementation of these data
                models, creating an information-rich marketplace of OA publications.

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>The success of the Open Access publishing model is highly dependent on a thriving, transparent
                marketplace. Researchers need to quickly and reliably identify high-quality, relevant and reputable
                Open Access publications that will maximize their publishing impact. Conversely, quality Open Access
                publishers must be able to distinguish themselves from the fray of “predatory” journals and unproven
                startups. By aggregating price information and impact data we empower researchers to identify credible
                Open Access journals that best fit their publication needs. We also alert the community to unreliable
                and predatory publishers. Our goal is to increase the use, reliability, and influence of OpenAccess
                publishing, while decreasing the motivation of predatory publishers by exposing them to the community.

            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>Our article processing charges are scraped directly from several publisher’s websites.
                We maintain a database consisting of the publishers, publication names, and article processing charges,
                as well as a handful of other metrics. We then calculate each publication’s influence score using Jevin
                West’s ArticleInfluence metric. Our database has journal prices for some journals as far back as 2012,
                and more historical prices are being added for more effective analysis. We believe in sharing our data
                openly and have created a well-documented <a href="/api/docs/">REST API</a> so that you can easily
                access this data.

            <h2>Types of Journal</h2>
            <p>A hybrid open access journal is a subscription journal in which some of the articles are open access.
                This status typically requires the payment of a publication fee (also called an article processing
                charge or APC) to the publisher, in addition to the subscription fee paid by the reader.
                (Found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open_access_journal">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
            <p>A "fully" open access journal contains exclusively articles that are open access. Such journals usually
            have an article processing charge paid by the author, but do not require a subscription to be accessed. </p>
